Rules:
1. Bees can be placed in any hex in a hive. A placed bee will transform a hex.

2. If a hex neighbors at least three transformed hexes, the bees will transform it too.

3. You cannot move bees once they are placed.

4. The goal is to fill the whole hive with the least amount of bees possible.
